          Hello my name is Joshua Aldrich. I have had a passion for coding ever
          since I started my college degree. I ended up taking a break to focus
          on working for a couple years but decided to get back into it once I
          saved enough to join the UCF coding bootcamp. I have constantly
          watched videos on youtube and the passion for coding hasn't left so
          I'm glad to take this opportunity to make coding a career path. I
          really enjoy the journey of constantly learning which I've been able
          to embark on with this course I'm currently taking.
